A pure-Rust **SCSS → CSS compiler** — a from-scratch dart-sass alternative.
Zero runtime dependencies, wasm-friendly, usable as a **library** and a
**CLI**, and designed to match **current** dart-sass byte-for-byte on the
subset it implements.

> Status: v0.x, maturing fast. Compiles real-world SCSS and indented `.sass`
> byte-identically to dart-sass 1.100, and **passes 100% of the *attempted*
> official [sass-spec](https://github.com/sass/sass-spec) suite
> (13,896 / 13,896, zero failures)** — tracked as a ratchet (see
> [Conformance](#conformance) for exactly what that denominator means). What
> remains is real-world breadth and hardening, not spec coverage.

## Why another Sass compiler?

`grass` is the incumbent Rust implementation and a strong one (it compiles
Bootstrap/Bulma byte-accurately and is ~2× faster than dart-sass). But it is
pinned to dart-sass **1.54.3** (mid-2022) and predates the CSS Color Level 4
overhaul, so it diverges from current dart-sass on, e.g., fractional color
channels (`rgb(63.75, 127.5, 191.25)` vs rounded hex) and emits hex where
dart-sass now keeps `rgb()`/`hsl()` forms. `sasso` targets **current**
dart-sass exactly, with a span-first parser, a modern color model, and a
zero-dependency, sandbox-friendly core. See
[`docs/GRASS_LANDSCAPE.md`](docs/GRASS_LANDSCAPE.md) for the full analysis.

## Features (this slice)

- `$variables`, lexical scoping, `!default`, `!global`
- Nesting, the `&` parent selector (with selector-list multiplication), and
  combinator normalization (`>`, `+`, `~`)
- `#{}` interpolation in selectors, property names and values
- `//` (stripped) and `/* */` (preserved) comments
- Numbers with units and unit arithmetic (`$pad * 2 → 16px`)
- A full color model with fractional channels + author-spelling preservation
  (`red`, `#336699`, `rgb()`/`hsl()` round-trip unchanged)
- Color functions: `rgb`/`rgba`/`hsl`/`hsla`/`mix`/`lighten`/`darken`/
  `percentage` (+ `red`/`green`/`blue`/`alpha`)
- `@import` partial inlining through a pluggable [`Importer`] (CSS imports
  pass through)
- `expanded` and `compressed` output styles
- Verbatim preservation of CSS functions it doesn't own (`calc`, `var`,
  `clamp`, `translateX`, …)

Since this slice was written the ratchet has added a great deal more —
`@mixin`/`@function`, control flow (`@if`/`@each`/`@for`/`@while`), `@extend`
and `%placeholder`s, a `calc()` engine, the CSS unit system + math functions,
full CSS Color 4 color spaces (`oklch`/`lab`/`color()`…), structured
`@media`/`@supports`, maps, the `@use`/`@forward` module system (built-in
`sass:*` modules + user files), and the indented `.sass` syntax. **The
compiler now passes 100% of the attempted sass-spec suite (13,896 / 13,896,
zero failures)** byte-for-byte against dart-sass 1.100 — 11,405 byte-exact CSS
outputs plus 2,491 error specs it correctly rejects (see
[Conformance](#conformance)).

## Install

**CLI — prebuilt binaries.** Every release ships static binaries for Linux
(gnu + musl), macOS and Windows (x86_64 / aarch64), built with
[cargo-dist](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist). Grab one from the
[Releases](https://github.com/momiji-rs/sasso/releases) page, or:

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/momiji-rs/sasso/releases/latest/download/sasso-installer.sh | sh   # Linux/macOS
$ cargo binstall sasso        # fetch the prebuilt binary
$ cargo install sasso         # build from source (needs a Rust toolchain)
```

**Library — crates.io.**

```console
$ cargo add sasso
```

**WebAssembly — npm.** A tiny, dependency-free wasm build for JS build tools
and the browser (no wasm-bindgen, no native add-ons):

```console
$ npm install @momiji-rs/sasso
```

```js
import { compile } from "@momiji-rs/sasso";
compile("a { color: #ffffff }", { style: "compressed" }); // a{color:#fff}
```

## Library usage

```rust
use sasso::{compile, Options, OutputStyle};

let scss = "$c: #336699; .a { color: $c; &:hover { color: lighten($c, 10%); } }";
let css = compile(scss, &Options::default()).unwrap();
assert!(css.contains("a:hover"));

// Minified:
let min = compile(scss, &Options::default().with_style(OutputStyle::Compressed)).unwrap();
```

`@import` resolution is controlled by an [`Importer`] you supply, so file
access stays on your side of any sandbox:

```rust
use sasso::{compile, Importer, Options};

struct MyFs;
impl Importer for MyFs {
    fn resolve(&self, path: &str) -> Option<String> {
        std::fs::read_to_string(format!("scss/_{path}.scss")).ok()
    }
}
let css = compile("@import \"base\";", &Options::default().with_importer(&MyFs)).unwrap();
```

A ready-made [`FsImporter`] is provided for standalone/CLI use.

## CLI usage

```console
$ cargo install --path .            # installs the `sasso` binary
$ sasso input.scss              # CSS to stdout (expanded)
$ sasso --style=compressed input.scss
$ sasso -I scss/ main.scss      # add @import load paths
$ echo '.a{color:red}' | sasso --stdin
```

## Conformance

The official sass-spec suite is the parity oracle. The harness in
[`spec/`](spec/) runs the compiler against every spec case and reports a
pass rate; we ratchet it upward over time.

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| sass-spec commit | `c6ac9a3` (dart-sass 1.100.0) |
| Total cases | 13,904 |
| Attempted (excl. 8 dart-sass `:todo`) | 13,896 |
| **Passing** | **13,896 — 100% of attempted · 0 failures** (99.94% of all 13,904) |
| ↳ byte-exact CSS output | 11,405 |
| ↳ error specs correctly rejected | 2,491 |

*Passing* = byte-exact CSS output match **plus** error specs the compiler
correctly rejects — the standard sass-spec conformance metric (the harness
checks that an error spec errors; the error *message* is tracked separately as
a non-gating metric). The 8 excluded cases are tagged `:todo` for **dart-sass
itself** upstream — dart-sass doesn't pass them either; sasso matches
dart-sass's actual behaviour on all 8 regardless.

**Strict input validation, too.** Matching dart-sass means rejecting what
dart-sass rejects, not just reproducing its output. sasso errors — rather than
silently accepting — on an invalid hex literal (`#00000`), out-of-grammar
`rgb()`/`hsl()` arguments, a duplicate `@mixin`/`@function` parameter, a
misplaced `@content`/`@extend`, a style rule or declaration inside a
`@function` body, a malformed `:nth-child()` / empty `:not()` selector, a bad
`@charset` or `@at-root (…)` query, and more — each with dart-sass's exact
message.

Run it yourself:

```console
$ spec/fetch.sh                                      # clone the suite
$ cargo build --release
$ SASS_BIN=target/release/sasso python3 spec/run_spec.py
```

## Performance

`sasso` is a native, in-process library — no subprocess, no Node, no Dart VM —
so startup is effectively free, which dominates when a build compiles many
files. On an Apple M2 Max it is the **fastest** of the three engines measured,
beating dart-sass by 19–30× end-to-end and leading `grass` (the incumbent Rust
compiler) by ~2.3–2.9×:

| Axis | sasso | grass | dart-sass (bin) | npx sass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Startup² | **1.8 ms** | 1.8 ms | 139 ms | 495 ms |
| Cold single large file | **11.7 ms** | 26.5 ms | 354 ms | 710 ms |
| Batch (40 files, 1 process) | **49.0 ms** | 136 ms | 916 ms | — |
| Pure compile (startup removed) | **7.4 ms** | 21.3 ms | ~216 ms¹ | — |

¹ derived (cold − startup) — dart-sass has no in-process loop mode. So sasso is
~29× faster than dart-sass on **pure compute**, ~30× on a cold single file, and
~77× on startup; vs `grass` it is ~2.3× cold / ~2.8× batch / ~2.9× pure.

² Startup compiles a 1-rule file, so it sits at the OS process-spawn floor —
sasso and grass measure **identically (1.8 ms)** here (the *mean* is dominated
by scheduler jitter at this sub-2 ms scale). The native library and wasm builds
remove process startup entirely. A
**scoped bump-arena allocator** (one audited `unsafe` module, Miri- and
AddressSanitizer-verified; the rest of the library stays `unsafe`-free) gives a
further ~1.5× by turning each compile's allocations into a pointer bump freed
wholesale at the end. Composite values (strings, lists, maps) are
reference-counted, so reading a `$variable` is an O(1) refcount bump, not a
deep copy — on a large list passed through a call chain without mutation this
cuts both instructions (~7×) and peak memory (~13×). Full methodology,
per-file numbers and the correctness diff are in
[`bench/three_way.md`](bench/three_way.md); run it yourself with
`cd bench && RUNS=12 WARMUP=3 LOOP_N=200 bash scripts/run_bench.sh`.

## WebAssembly

Because the library is zero-dependency and pure `std`, it compiles to
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm32-wasip1` out of the box (built in CI). The
deployable `.wasm` cdylib ships in two variants, published to npm as
[`@momiji-rs/sasso`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@momiji-rs/sasso):

| Variant | Build | Over the wire | Compile (large, in Node)³ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **size** (default) | `opt-level = "z"` + LTO + `panic = "abort"` + `strip` + `wasm-opt -Oz` | **~854 KB / ~356 KB gzip** | ~27 ms |
| **speed** (`@momiji-rs/sasso/speed`) | `opt-level = 3` + `wasm-opt -O3` | **~1.84 MB / ~637 KB gzip** | ~12 ms |

³ in-process compile of the same large file, Node 22 (best-of-N). The wasm tax
over native `sasso` (7.7 ms) is ~1.5× for the speed build and ~3.5× for the
size build; the wasm build runs without the bump arena. Even so the **speed
build (~12 ms) beats native `grass` (21 ms)** and every dart-sass form a Node
toolchain can run.

A whole modern Sass compiler — `@use`/`@forward`, `@extend`, the calc engine,
CSS Color 4 — in a few hundred KB gzipped, far smaller than shipping the
dart-sass compiler as JavaScript. A browser playground is tracked in the issues.

## Language bindings

The compiler is usable beyond Rust:

| Language | Package | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **JavaScript / wasm** | [`@momiji-rs/sasso`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@momiji-rs/sasso) (npm) | the in-repo [`wasm/`](wasm/) cdylib — see [WebAssembly](#webassembly) above |
| **Ruby** | [`sasso`](https://rubygems.org/gems/sasso) (RubyGems) | [`momiji-rs/sasso-ruby`](https://github.com/momiji-rs/sasso-ruby) — an in-process native extension (`magnus` + `rb-sys`) around this crate |

The Ruby gem lives in its own repo (the norm for Rust-backed gems) and pins a
published `sasso` crate version; file gem-specific issues there.
